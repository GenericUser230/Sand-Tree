# Sand-Tree

An incremental game based on The Prestige Tree. Collect sand, which can then be made into rocks, which can be used in upgrades. Eventually, your rocks will start to retain heat and melt into magma, or stack high enough to generate pressure. From there, you can make glass, which can collect water, refine rocks into metal, and eventually create life - hope for the world.
